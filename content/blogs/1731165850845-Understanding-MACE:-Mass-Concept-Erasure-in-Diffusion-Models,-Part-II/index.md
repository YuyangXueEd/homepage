## Closed-Form Cross-Attention Refinement

Lu et al. [^p1] suggest a closed-form cross-attention refinement to encourage the model to refrain from embedding residual information of the target phrase into other words. They looked into the cross-attention layer, where the text embedding of a token encapsulates information from other tokens. This results in its `Key` and `Value` vectors.

In machine unlearning, a standard way of forgetting a concept is to find an anchor concept and make the target concept move to the anchor. In MACE, when altering the projection matrix \\(W_k\\), they modify it such that the `Keys` of the words that coexist with the target phrase in the prompt are mapped to the `Keys` of those same words in another prompt, where the target phrase is replaced with either its super-category or a generic concept. The illustration here is to show how closed-form cross-attention refinement can help remove residual.

They fomulated the objective function as follows:

$$
\displaystyle \underset{W_{k}^{'}}{\min}\sum _{i=1}^{n} \| W_{k}^{'} \ \cdot e_{i}^{f} -W_{k}^{'} \ \cdot e_{i}^{g} \| _{2}^{2} +\lambda _{1}\sum _{i=n+1}^{n+m} \| W_{k}^{'} \ \cdot e_{i}^{p} -W_{k}^{'} \ \cdot e_{i}^{p} \| _{2}^{2}
$$
