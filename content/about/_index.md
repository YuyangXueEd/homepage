<br>
He was invited to organize a tutorial at the 2024 International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) and served as a keynote speaker, delivering multiple presentations at top conferences like CVPR and MICCAI. He holds a National Intermediate Software Engineer certification from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of China and is a student member of IEEE and the International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (ISMRM). Xue Yuyang obtained his Master's degree in Computer Science from the University of Southampton and his Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Fuzhou University. With extensive experience in machine learning and its applications, he has co-authored 25 conference papers and journal articles, as well as two technical patents, with various collaborators and partners. Moreover, he serves as a reviewer for several renowned conferences in the fields of computer vision and medical imaging, such as CVPR, ICLR, ECCV, MICCAI, and ISBI, as well as top journals like TNNLS, TMI, and MedAI.
