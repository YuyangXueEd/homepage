Dr. Yuyang Xue holds a Ph.D. from the Department of Engineering at the University of Edinburgh, with a research focus on cutting-edge fields including machine unlearning, vision-language models, and medical imaging. 
Throughout his academic career, he has driven impactful research through extensive collaborations with leading institutions worldwide, such as the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)-funded Center for Healthcare AI and Real Data Causality AI (CHAI), Canon Europe Medical Headquarters, the Archimedes Research Center of AI Excellence in Athens, and the Fujian Province Key Laboratory of Medical Devices and Pharmaceutical Technology.
<br>
<br>
As an active contributor to the scientific community, Dr. Xue organized a widely-attended tutorial at the 2024 International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) and has delivered presentations at premier conferences, including CVPR and MICCAI. He holds a National Intermediate Software Engineer certification from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of China, and is a member of IEEE and the International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (ISMRM). Yuyang earned his Master's degree in Computer Science from the University of Southampton and his Bachelor's degree from Fuzhou University. With deep expertise in machine learning applications, he has co-authored over 25 publications in top-tier conferences and journals, and holds two technical patents. He also routinely serves as a reviewer for leading venues such as CVPR, ICLR, ECCV, MICCAI, and ISBI, as well as esteemed journals like TNNLS, TMI, and MedAI.
